## Enzyme-Protocol-Fork

Built an android application for the Radar Protocol that is a fork of Enzyme Protocol.
The app is a crowd-fund Dapp where users can contribute and invest their crypto in various protocols. 
Users can create various multiple funds and assign policies to them. 
Each fund can be updated to later releases. 

Its implementation was in three modules, namely; Smart contracts using solidity, backend using Node js and the front end using Reactjs Web3js, ethers.js and GraphQl. 
The build is purely smart contract based, and Front-end with React JS
